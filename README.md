For deobfuscation I used modified version of RetroGuard (source code attached) and [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma).

# Mods
## Build-in ModLoader is broken. Mods will not work.
Cypress uses modified version of ModLoader for Alpha 1.2.6.

You can port mods from Alpha 1.1.2_01 up to Beta 1.2_01 or create your own. (You can port mods from Beta 1.2_02 and above, but significant modification is needed)
